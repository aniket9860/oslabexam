1. List the directory contents date wise sorted.
=> ls -t -r -l 

2. List the directory contents size wise sorted.
=> ls -S -l -h -r

3. List directory contents along with their inode no.
=> ls -i -l -h | sort -n

4. List the contents of sub directory.
=> ls Aniket -l

5. Create a file , write your surname and name in it and save.
  i. now open the same file and add your address in it and save.
  ii. reopen the same file and check your name and address in it.
=> cat > Question5.txt
   Surname: Madwe
   Name: Aniket
   cat >> Question5.txt 
   Address : wardha, Maharashtra
   cat Question5.txt

6. how to change the time stamp of file 
=> touch Aniket

7. Create directory structure : Give following commands ,
-> mkdir one
-> cd one
-> touch 1.txt 11.txt 111.txt
-> mkdir two
-> cd two
-> touch 2.txt 22.txt 222.txt
-> mkdir three
-> cd three
-> touch 3.txt 33.txt 333.txt
-> mkdir four
-> cd four
-> touch 4.txt 44.txt 444.txt
-> mkdir five
-> cd five
-> touch 5.txt 55.txt 555.txt
-> cd ~ (i.e. go to your home directory)
=>
mkdir one
cd one
touch 1.txt 11.txt 111.txt
mkdir two
cd two
touch 2.txt 22.txt 222.txt
mkdir three
cd three
touch 3.txt 33.txt 333.txt
mkdir four 
cd four
touch 4.txt 44.txt 444.txt
mkdir five
cd five
touch 5.txt 55.txt 555.txt
cd ~

8. Considering above directory structure , Do following operations :
i. list the directory contents of directory named "five" from current directory (i.e. home directory).
=> ls -l one/two/three/four/five

ii. write your name in a file named "44.txt" of directory "four" from current directory.
=> cat > one/two/three/four/44.txt
   cat one/two/three/four/44.txt

iii. remove the file named "555.txt" from directory "five" from current directory.
=> rm one/two/three/four/five/555.txt

iv. change directory to five ( i.e. cd one/two/three/four/five/ ).
=>cd one/two/three/four/five

v. write your course name in file named "3.txt" which resides in directory "three" from current directory (i.e. five).also read the same file.
=> cat >  ../../3.txt
   CourseName : PG-DAC
   cat ../../3.txt

vi. list the contents of directory "two" from current directory (i.e. five).
=> ls -l ../../../

vii. remove file named "222.txt" which belongs to directory "two" from current directory (i.e. five)
=> rm ../../../222.txt

viii. now change the directory to "one"
=> cd ../../../../

ix. remove all files only from directory named "five" from current directory (i.e. one)
=> rm two/three/four/five/*

x. remove directory named "five" from current directory (i.e. one)
=> rmdir two/three/four/five

xi. remove whole directory named "four" from current directory (i.e. one)
=> rm -R  two/three/four

xii. change to your home directory.
=> cd ~

9. change the time stamp of file named "3.txt" which resides in directory named "three".(man touch)
=> touch one/two/three/3.txt

10. Create a file named "data.txt" and write following 6 lines in it(write as it is).
"Linux is open source.
In linux everything
is file. files have permissions.
files have inode no.
files have size.
there are several types of file"

i. count the no. of words ,characters and lines from above file.(man wc)
=> wc data.txt

ii. list the lines having word "files" (man grep)
=> grep "files" data.txt

iii. list the lines having word "file" (man grep)
=> grep "file" data.txt

iv. list the lines which don't have word "files" (man grep)
=> grep -v  "files" data.txt

v. list the lines having word "have" along with count. (man grep)
=> grep -n "have" data.txt

vi. list the lines starts with letter "f" (man grep)
=> grep "^f" data.txt

vii. list the lines ends with "g" (man grep)
=> grep "g$" data.txt

viii. list only first two lines.(man head)
=> head -2 data.txt

ix. list only last three lines.(man tail)
=> tail -3 data.txt

x. list line no.3,4 and 5 . (man head and tail)
=> cat data.txt | head -5 | tail -3
